Normal balloons use a "Track to" object constraint. Number balloons (0..9 and fractions) use a "Damped Track" object constraint to allow easier rotation.Strings can be added to number balloons by duplicating an existing string and changing parent and "Hook modifier" as required.The number balloons material is a composed of a transparent balloon png and an adjustable background colour.</blockquote><hr /><h3>Help us moderate this file</h3><p>Blend Swap is a place to share and get awesome 3D work, if you think this blend falls into one of the following issues please file a report from <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/94146">http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/94146</a> by clicking on the <strong>Manage</strong> panel to the left of the blend and then on <strong>Report/Flag</strong>:</p><ul><li>The blend author didn't make this blend and posted it as their own.</li><li>The blend author is violating a Creative Commons License or copyright.</li><li>The blend is incomplete, work in progress, or has missing textures.</li><li>The blend contains simulation cache files and other unneeded media.</li><li>The preview image has nothing to do with the blend's contents.</li></ul><p>Your help allows the site to stay clear of broken and stolen work.</p><hr /><h4>Notes:</h4><ul><li>Do NOT report this blend if you dont' know how to use a feature on Blender, instead use the <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/questions">questions section</a> of the site.</li></ul>    </article>    <footer>        Original file hosted by <a href="https://www.blendswap.com">Blend Swap, LLC</a>.    </footer></body></html>
